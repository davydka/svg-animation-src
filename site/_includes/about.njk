  <h3>How Does This Work</h3>

  <p>SVGs allow you to embed CSS stylesheets. Each animation is no more than a series of CSS animations moving around or transforming basic SVG elements.</p>

  {% include "about/example1.njk" %}

  <p>In many cases animations are stacked on top of each other using groups of elements to create more complex motions.</p>

  {% include "about/example2.njk" %}

  <p>I also made liberal use animating dash-offsets on paths (see <a href="http://jakearchibald.com/2013/animated-line-drawing-svg/">Jake Archibald's fantastic explanation</a> on how this works).</p>

  {% include "about/example3.njk" %}

  <h3>What Libraries Did You Use</h3>

      <a href="http://glmatrix.net/">gl-matrix</a> — For vector/matrix manipulation.</li>
    <li>
      <a href="https://github.com/postcss/postcss">postcss</a> — For processing/modifying inline stylesheets.</li>
    <li>
      <a href="https://github.com/ben-eb/perfectionist">perfectionist</a> — For cleaning up the inline stylesheets.</li>
    <li>

    </li>
    <li>A bunch of other utilities like <a href="https://lodash.com/">lodash</a>, <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/eases">eases</a>, <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/case">case</a>, and <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/seedrandom">seedrandom</a>.</li>
    <li>
      <a href="https://www.11ty.io/">11ty</a> — To generate this static site.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>For rendering SVGs I wrote my own tiny (read: horrible) renderer as I wanted a chance to play around with <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Proxy">proxy objects</a>.</p>

  <h3>Credits</h3>

  <p>While the majority of the designs underlying the animations are of my own creation, I did find a number of inspirations on places like pinterest and google image search. Any animations that are based on the work of others has attribution included inline, but I also wanted to call them all out in one place:</p>

  <ul>
    {% for attribution, dirs in svgs.attributionMap %}
      <li>
        {% for dirName, attributedSvgs in dirs %}
          <a href="{{ attributedSvgs[0].dir.url }}">{{ dirName }}</a> -

          {% for svg in attributedSvgs %}
            <a href="{{svg.url | url}}">{{svg.fileName | upper}}</a>{{ "," if not loop.last else ":" }}
          {% endfor %}
        {% endfor %}
        {{ attribution | safe }}
      </li>
    {% endfor %}
  </ul>

  <h3>Notes</h3>

  <ul>
    <li id="footnote-1">† — <span class="no-wrap">(ಥ﹏ಥ)</span> There are two reasons why there are some rasterized images in the repo:
      <ol>
        <li>
          Few browsers support <a href="https://caniuse.com/#feat=link-icon-svg">SVG favicons</a>, as of late 2019 anyway.
        </li>
        <li>
          Since most websites that parse <a href="https://ogp.me/">Open Graph</a> metadata don't support SVGs as og:image values, I wrote a small <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/tools/puppeteer">puppeteer</a> script to render each SVG animation as a jpg. These images will only be served to bots and other sites.
        </li>
      </ol>
    </li>
    <li id="footnote-2">‡ — JavaScript was used to generate this site and each animation, but no javascript is actually running when you load the page in your browser (except for google analytics).</li>
  </ul>
